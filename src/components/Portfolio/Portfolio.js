It uses the Unsplash API to deliver images and a proprietary algorithm to segment the images into puzzles that can be solved using Rubik's Cube-like motions."

We used infinite-scrolling on this one as well, adapting it for use with React, and also recursive nesting of the comments for each article."

This was an early exercise in reading API data and using React, so it just shows information about different beers and some filters. I used it as an opportunity to practice the infinite-scrolling method of API data presentation."

Sometimes people get the idea that they're doing it one way now, but would do it differently if it was 'for real,' but I think you get more from it if you always do it like it's 'for real.'"

By tracking the vertical scrollbar, you can tell if the user is near the bottom of the page and load more data.
